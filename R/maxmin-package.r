#' maxmin: find the diff in quantiles
#'
#' A crazy simple use of baseR max and min to find the difference. Then a slightly more interesting generalized version that can take any quantile of interest to the user.
#' qdiff includes a couple different arguments including na.rm and control of which type of algorithm generates the quantile.
